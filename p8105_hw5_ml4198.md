# Problem 1

### Read and tidy data

``` r
homicide_df = read.csv("./data/homicide_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")
  )
```

The homicide dataframe has 52179 rows and 13 columns. Information
included on murders in 50 US cities from 2007-2017. Murders are
classified as open/no arrest, closed by arrest, and closed without
arrest.

### Homicides per city

First total homicides per city

``` r
total_homicides =
homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_homicides = n(),
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Then unsolved homicides per city

``` r
unsolved_homicides =
  homicide_df %>%
  filter(disposition == "Closed without arrest" | disposition == "Open/No arrest") %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    n_open_homicides = n()
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Then join dataframes

``` r
open_total_homicides =
    full_join(unsolved_homicides, total_homicides)
```

    ## Joining, by = "city_state"

``` r
open_total_homicides[is.na(open_total_homicides)] <- 0
```

### Proportion of homicides that are unsolved

First in Baltimore, MD

``` r
prop.test(
open_total_homicides %>%  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%  pull(n_open_homicides),
open_total_homicides %>%  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%  pull(n_homicides)
) %>%
broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Then iterate prop.test across all cities

``` r
results = 
open_total_homicides %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = n_open_homicides, .y = n_homicides, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## Warning: Problem with `mutate()` input `prop_tests`.
    ## ℹ Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect
    ## ℹ Input `prop_tests` is `map2(...)`.

    ## Warning in prop.test(x = .x, n = .y): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

### Plotting

``` r
results %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

## Problem 2

### Read and tidy data

Includes multiple spreadsheets

``` r
longitudinal_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("prob_2"),
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("prob_2/", path),
    data = map(path, read_csv)
    ) %>%
  unnest(data) %>%
  mutate(path = str_replace(path, "prob_2/", " "),
         path = str_replace(path, ".csv", " ")) %>%
  separate(path, into = c("group", "id"), sep = "_") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week", 
    names_prefix = "week_", 
    values_to = "observations"
  ) %>%
  relocate(id) %>%
  mutate(
    group = as.factor(group),
    week = as.numeric(week)
  )
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time

``` r
longitudinal_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observations, color = id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(.~group)
```

Observations over time are relatively stable in control arm and increase
over time in experimental arm.
